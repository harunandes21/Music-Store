largely, a lot of what happens in music store needs to move to library
	
write/read username password file
	hash/salt
	
track song plays
	if a song is played x times, add it to favorites by default

track song genres
	if there are 10 of a genre or more within the user library, create a genre playlist with those songs, 
	which should not be deletable. 
	
track recently played songs
	implement .play() method for songs
	create a list of 10 most recently played songs
	
track 10 most frequently played songs
	
add "Top Rated" playlist with all songs of rating 4/5, where the playlist and its songs are undeletable.

login system
	read password, check with account.attemptLogin(password), bring up ui with the correct library
	upon logout, user library should be saved
	
sorting by:
	title
	artist
	rating (rating, then name)
	shuffle (collections.shuffle())
	
when adding a song to the library
	add album of that song, but only songs within the library should show up in that playlist
	
search by song by genre

sort search results

CHANGES FOR BETTER GRADE  (According to feedback) :
- Convert storage to hash maps
- Remove escaping references
- Change UI to "text-based"
- Add songs to library directly
- Get list of song/artists
- Searching for song by artist/album/title
- Remove .setAlbum() for song
- Printing should be done on view
- Rating should be double (dumb mistake)
- Video Organization (apparently)
- UML Diagram needs var names (no tf it doesn't, it never has)
